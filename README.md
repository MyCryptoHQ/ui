# [MyCrypto UI](https://mycryptobuilds.com/ui)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MyCryptoHQ/ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MyCryptoHQ/ui)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MyCryptoHQ/ui/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/MyCryptoHQ/ui?branch=master)

The shared UI component library used across all MyCrypto products.

Implemented with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) components following [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/).

## Installation

Requires a bundler with ES module support.

`yarn add @mycrypto/ui styled-components`

Wrap your app in a `ThemeProvider` to use the included `light` and `dark` themes.

```js
import { Button, light } from '@mycrypto/ui';
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

<ThemeProvider theme={light}>
  <Button>Button</Button>
</ThemeProvider>;
```

## Typeface

Our designs use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/) and [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) typefaces, which you will probably need to install in your app or site. There are several options depending on your requirements and build tooling:

- Use [typeface-lato](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeface-lato) and [typeface-roboto-mono](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeface-roboto-mono) to self-host your typefaces when using npm/yarn with Webpack or any other build tool with CSS and font loaders ([instructions](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces#how))
- Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Lato:400,700,900|Roboto+Mono) to load the fonts from a CDN (over the Internet) without any configuration (note that [Google collects some usage data](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users))
- Download [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/) and [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) directly if you need more control over font loading or if you only plan on using the fonts locally

## Development

You can launch the storybook simply by running `yarn start`

## Deployment

The npm package is automatically updated by Travis whenever a new tag is pushed to the remote.
To facilitate version management we use [yarn version](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/version/). To release a new version you just need to run:

```
  yarn version --major|--minor|--patch
```

This command will bump the version in the `package.json` file AND create an associated `tag`.
After this, you must simply push the code and the tag to Github.

```
  git push && git push --tags
```
